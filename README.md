Seq is a lazy sequence library for go. It is inspired by Clojure's sequence functions. It originally started because I was interested in transducers and wanted to play with them. Most of the functions in the library are implemeneted as transducers in the [jsouthworth.net/go/transduce](https://godoc.org/jsouthworth.net/go/transduce) library and wrapped with a XfrmSequence here. This library relies heavily on reflection to allow for the most flexibility in what the user provides. This means that it is only type checked at runtime.

## Getting started

## Acknowledgments

* Clojure's sequence library was the source of inspiration for the organization of this library and the names of the functions.

## TODO

* [ ] Implement a few more functions like flatten.
* [ ] Add more conversions for go types (maps as entry sequences, etc.).
